## About Me

I am currently a 5th year CS Ph.D. student at the [University of Maryland](https://www.cs.umd.edu/), supervised by [Professor Ming Lin](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~lin/) at the [GAMMA Group](https://gamma.umd.edu/). My north star in research is safer, more transparent, and interpretable autonomous driving. 
I believe that designing deep learning frameworks for driving with interpretable and transferable priors in mind will ultimately lead to safer, socially-viable, and impactful policies. 
More specifically, my research interest involves combining simulation techniques and deep learning for autonomous driving and general multi-agent interaction scenarios. 
While this paradigm has been explored for physics-based simulation, applying it to traffic simulation is challenging since existing mathematical models of simulation describe approximations (rather than exact pathing) of human beings. 
Previously, I interned at [Waymo](https://waymo.com/) with Omar Makhlouf, [Kitware](https://www.kitware.com/) with Brian Clipp and at [GESDISC, NASA Goddard SFC / ADNET Systems](https://disc.gsfc.nasa.gov/) with Arif Albayrak, William Teng, and Mohammad Khayat.

## Hobbies and Side Quests
FPS and RPG games are one of my favorite past times. Currently, I play VALORANT and Genshin Impact. Two of my favorite titles of all time are Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, and [Enderal: Forgotten Stories](https://store.steampowered.com/app/933480/Enderal_Forgotten_Stories/), which started out as a Skyrim mod but has a beautiful storyline and fun combat mechanics. I can't recommend Enderal enough.. if you like Skyrim, you will love Enderal. My favorite music to listen to is original soundtracks from video games, films, and classical music (particularly Liszt and Rachmaninoff).

I also played on the UMD women's club ice hockey team from 2016-2019 as left wing. It was a blast. Check out the team [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/terpswhockey/) if you want to support!

Here's a playlist of various uploads from my childhood YouTube account, where I post funny music/skating performance videos, gaming montages and the occasional travel vlog:
